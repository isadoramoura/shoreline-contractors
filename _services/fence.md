<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Does the Fence Have to be Sanded Before Painting? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Before any fence painting, the old paint should be scraped off and the fence sanded. The fence should also be rid of rust, mould and dirt. Sanding the fence before the painting creates cleaner and smoother surfaces that will give you better finishes and better paint adherence. Our Melbourne fence painters can do all the prepping work, including sanding with a thoroughness that will result in top-notch quality finishes on your fences after the painting.</p>

<h4 class="h6">How many coats of paint will the fence need?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>The number of coats of paints has a direct bearing on the cost of professional fence painting. For top quality and lasting fence painting finishes, at least two coats of paint are generally recommended. There are instances where three coats of paint should suffice. Depending on the type of fence being painted -whether metal, Colourbond, wood, timber or concrete fencing- there are cases where you might need three coats of paint on your fences. Talk to our professional Melbourne fence painters for expert advice on the coats to use on your Melbourne fences.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should I Treat My Fence Before Painting It? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Here at Newline Painting, we always recommend that our clients consider treating their fences before painting to ensure maximum protection from the elements. If the fence is bare or made from untreated wood, then pre-treatment is necessary before painting to prevent decay or rot and preserve them for the long haul. If the wood has previously been treated and painted, then it may have to be stripped bare and treated afresh.</p>

<h4 class="h6">How Often Should a Fence be Painted? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>The frequency of fence painting will depend on various factors such as the material used on the fence, climate, the type of paint used on the fence and the treatment and techniques used in the fence painting. Professional fence painters at Newline Painting can always assure you of lasting outcomes on top of excellent workmanship.</p>
<p>Wooden fences may have to be repainted after two to three years to restore the paintwork to an excellent condition. The orientation of the fence may also affect the frequency with which it will have to be repainted. If it is facing the sun and has maximum exposure to the UV rays from the sunshine, then the paint deteriorates at a faster rate hence the paintwork will have a shorter lifespan.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should the wood be primed before painting? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>For a longer lasting impact, we recommend that wooden fences be primed before painting. The use of a primer provides better protection for the wood surface. It also ensures that the paint will better adhere to the wood surface.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should the fence be pressure washed before painting? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>To improve the adherence of the paint and ensure better quality finishes, it is essential that the surface be clean and smooth before painting. The fence should, therefore, be pressure-washed to get rid of the dirt before the application of paint.</p>

<h4 class="h6">What is the Best Paint for Colorbond Fences? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Colorbond steel fences are best painted with water-based acrylic paints. However, if the Colorbond fence is corroded, we recommend using a paint type with enhanced corrosion resistance. When it comes to Colorbond fences, choose a paint type that has excellent compatibility with steel. Go for paint that is exterior, acrylic and water-based. Our professional face painters can advise on the best paints to use for your Colorbond fences. Call us today for professional fence paint consultation.</p>
