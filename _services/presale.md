<h3>What is a Pre Sale House Paint?</h3>
<p></p><p>First impressions matter when you are putting a house on sale. Painting is often a low-cost and high-impact property makeover. Pre sale house painting dramatically improves the appeal of the property and will cost you very little. That is why giving your house some makeover to make it more appealing to potential buyers and renters is often a sure winner.</p>
<p>The more comprehensive renovation and remodeling projects are generally capital-intensive investments that you may never recoup in the final buying price. Alternatively, you can do a little refresh with small improvements that can still give your property a small edge in the real estate marketplace. Buyers and renters are often fickle-minded and the smallest renovations can tilt the deal in your favour.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Is a pre sale house painting worth it? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Should you paint your house before selling it? Of all the pre-sale house renovations that you can make, a pre sale paint is probably the cheapest and most high-impact house renovation that you can apply. A fresh layer of paint makes a great first impression when it is well done. It hides some cosmetic flaws and raises the value of your property considerably. Any fresh layer of paint of any colour will up the stakes in any property that you are about to list. For maximum impact that will leave a positive impression and appeal to a larger section of buyers, it is generally advisable to go for neutral colours. Choose a professional pre sale house painter, too, who will offer you professional counsel, good colour choice and who will pull off great finishes.</p>

<h4 class="h6">What colour should I paint my house to maximise the sell price? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Because you will be targeting a very broad and diverse foot traffic with your property listings, it is prudent to go for more neutral colors as well as earthly colour tones. This is one place where you can’t afford to personalize the décor as your individual tastes and preferences may not be everyone’s cup of tea. The ideal colours for pre sale house paint include light gray, warm beige or some off-white that verges on white or yellow. You can give your kitchens a gray or light blue hue.</p>

<h4 class="h6">What colour of house sells best? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>The colour of the house may seem like a trivial aspect when buying a home but for some buyers, it might tip the scales. When a buyer inspects the house for sale, they are already picturing themselves living in that house with all its features and colours. If the colour or finishing is a put-off, it could be a deal breaker. Neutral colours are the most recommended. The blues also make a great impression. You can also go for warm earth tones or a white colour which gives the property a trendy look.</p>

<h4 class="h6">How much does a pre sale house job cost? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>A pre sale house paint is quite cost-effective. In Australia, an interior house paint job costs $20 to $30 per square meter or $25 to $40 per hour. This excludes the cost of the paint and other materials. The lower estimate of these costs is based on the use of a single colour with little prepping and trim work. More complex paint jobs will, invariably, cost you more.</p>
<p>In the Island, this cost can vary anywhere from $2,500 to $20,000 depending on factors such as the size of the house, complexity, amount of prep work, the type of surface that is being painted as well as whether you are planning to do interior or exterior painting.</p>
<p>The interior painting for a standard two-bedroom housing unit costs anywhere from $2,500 to $3,500. The cost for painting a 2-storey home can be anywhere from $5,500 to $20,000. Roof painting can cost from $2,800 to $4,500.</p>

<h4 class="h6">When should you do a pre sale house paint? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Because you won’t want your house smelling of paint or brimming with wet paint when guests come streaming in, a pre sale paint should be done at least two weeks before you list the house in the market.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should I paint my house’s exterior before putting it on sale? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>In property listings, a poor initial impression is often a major deal breaker, killing a potential sale every time. The exterior of the house must be well-presented as this sets the expectations of what the prospective buyer can expect inside. A good house exterior is the first step to switching the buyer to the prospect of the sale.</p>
