<h3>How Much Does It Cost to Paint a Driveway?</h3>
<p></p><p>If you planning to paint your driveways, you will need to factor in the cost of paint and the labour costs for professional driveway painting. The cost of concrete paint will range from $14 to $20 per litre. There is also the cost of painting tools that you won’t have to worry about if you hire a professional painter who comes with their own tools.</p>
<p>For lasting results, the driveway will also need to be sealed with a waterproof sealer which comes with an extra cost. If you would like to personalize it further, you may also want to add some texture to the finishes.</p>
<p>However, if you are simply going for professional driveway painting, the cost can vary from $30 to $200 per square metre. The average cost of professional driveway painting in Melbourne is $65. The cost will vary depending on a number of factors such as the types of paint to be used, types of finishes or some access difficulty. If you will be going for complex finishes such as stamped concrete or stencilled concrete, the cost of painting and finishing your concrete driveways will be higher.</p>

<div class="col-sm-6">
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">What colour should I paint my driveways?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Earthly tones will work on your driveways any day. These remain the most popular colour preferences for concrete driveways as they will flawlessly blend into the natural landscape. These earthly tones will also effortlessly complement your house exteriors.</p>
<p>Because driveways are exposed to dirt and the elements, you’d want to use darker earth tones that will more easily conceal the tire marks, dirt as well as stains thereby making your concrete driveways look good and clean at all times. Overall, the earthly tones are much easier to maintain. Some of the preferred colours for concrete driveways include tan, sandy beige or some shades of brown.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">How should I prepare my concrete driveway for painting? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>For the best outcomes, the concrete driveway should be cleaned and primed. Remove the car(s) from the driveway and park them on the street on the material day. Sweep the driveway. Using a mixture of water and etch primer, scrub the driveway thoroughly with a tough broom. After it has been painted, the concrete driveway will need up to 7 days to cure before you can use it again.</p>
<p>At Newline Painting, we can handle the prep work with the thoroughness it requires to give you the best finishes when it comes to concrete driveway painting. Give us a call today for a prompt quote on your concrete driveway painting requirements.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">How long does the driveway painting last before it needs to be repainted? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Because the driveway is a high-traffic part of your premises that is exposed not only to foot traffic and vehicle tire treads but also to the elements, it will need a new coat of paint every 1 to 5 years depending on the paint quality, prepping, technique and workmanship of the painter.</p>
<p></p>

<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">What is the best type of paint for driveway painting? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>The driveway is a rugged part of your property that is exposed to a lot of ‘stresses’ be they from the tire treads, foot traffic or the elements. You will, therefore, need the right type of driveway paint that will be capable of withstanding these stresses over the long haul. With the right kind of paint, technique and workmanship, your painted driveway can last for up to 5 years before it has to be repainted or resealed once more.</p>
<p>Ideally, the best driveway paint should have a waterproof sealer that will provide maximum protection for your concrete surfaces over the long haul. At Newline Painting, our qualified, licensed and certified driveway painters in Melbourne have the knowledge and expertise to get you the best paints that will have long lasting performance on your concrete driveways.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should a Painted Driveway be Sealed? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>For long lasting protection for your concrete driveways, the driveway painting should be sealed using a waterproof sealer that provides excellent protection for years to come.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should I Stain or Paint my Concrete Driveways? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>When it comes to driveway treatments, you can opt for either staining or painting. Both of these will upgrade the look of your concrete driveways. Staining is generally more economical than painting although painting gives you a more versatile way of transforming the look and feel of your driveways to correspond with the general style and theme of your home. However, there are advantages you will derive from staining your driveways. Staining will deeply penetrate the surfaces and give you a finish that is more permanent, fade-resistant and one that does not peel away or flake off like paint. Whether to opt for staining or painting is a matter of personal preference. Newline Painting’s professional driveway painters can offer you professional consultation on the best course to undertake to bring out the best finishes on your driveways.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should I Hire a Professional Driveway Painter or Opt for DIY Driveway Painting? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>DIY driveway painting is appealing both from a cost perspective and as a DIY project that you can undertake in your free time. However, our professional driveway painters have the skills, knowledge and expertise to pull off exquisite and long-wearing driveway painting with exceptional workmanship.</p>
<p>Quality driveway painting requires comprehensive prep work and technique for the best outcomes that professionals can easily pull off. At Newline Painting, we can also offer you professional colour consultation and the best paints that will give you the best finishes on your driveways.</p>
