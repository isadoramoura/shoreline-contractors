                <h4 class="h6">Can I stay at home while you paint? (interior paint jobs)</h4>
                <div class="accordion__hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Short answer is yes you can. However, we highly recommend all customers to seek alternative
                        accomodation for the entire period that we are painting.</p>
                    <p>If the house interiors are being painted while the house is still occupied, it is strongly
                        recommended that you wait for between two and three days to allow the fresh paint to dry and for
                        its
                        fumes to slowly subside.</p>
                    <p>This is, particularly, necessary for people with respiratory problems and allergies. If the
                        property’s occupants are elderly, it is recommended that you allow several days before you move
                        back
                        in.</p>
                    <p>The fumes from the fresh interior painting aren’t generally conducive for the vulnerable or those
                        with poor health.</p>

                <div class="accordion__hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>If the property is vacant (no furniture), then you don’t need to do anything! As long as there is
                        power to the property, we’ll take care of all prep work before we start painting</p>
                    <p>If the apartment is occupied, preparations are required to protect your prized items before
                        painting
                        commences.</p>
                    <p>For instance, the furniture should be removed and covered. You should also remove the appliances,
                        electronics, ornaments, paintings, and ensure the soft furnishings are well protected.</p>
                    <p>The walls should be cleaned and prepped. Give us a call on 1300 044 206 to discuss what prep work
                        is
                        required for your occupied apartment.</p>

                <div class="accordion__hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>For interior apartment painting, it is generally advisable to go for the more neutral colour
                        tones
                        such as beige, grey, or off-white colours.</p>
                    <p>If you are painting the interior of a house that you will stay in, you will have lots of leeway
                        to
                        personalise your colour selections. For instance, you can opt for the warm-toned or cool-toned
                        colours.</p>
                    <p>You can also choose clear or more muted colours. The colour choice will also depend on the type
                        of
                        room being painted. We provide a free colour consultation service on every quote to find what
                        your
                        preferences to match you with the best colour palette.</p>

                <h4 class="h6">What paint types are best for interior apartment painting?</h4>
                <div class="accordion__hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Depending on your budget and personal preferences, there are different types of paints that you
                        can
                        use for your house interiors. The choice is between latex and oil-based paints. Most of the
                        standard
                        paint is water-based or acrylic/latex paint.</p>
                    <p>These give you a somewhat flat finish on your interior walls without any glare. These also dry
                        quickly and are the cheapest paints. Water-based paints can also conceal the minor imperfections
                        on
                        the wall.</p>
                    <p>On the other end of the spectrum are the premium quality gloss paints or oil-based paints with
                        various finishes such as egg shell, satin and semi-gloss that give you various degrees of
                        shininess.
                        These are mostly used for trim detailing. Our professional Melbourne interior house painters use
                        the
                        highest quality paint. If you need advice on the best paint to use for your interior home
                        painting
                        and the pros and cons of each paint, give us a call today.</p>
