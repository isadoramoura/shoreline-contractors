<h3>Thinking of Getting a Feature Wall Painted?</h3>
<p></p><p>A fancy feature wall or accent wall painting is the perfect way to bring out something unique and cool in your rooms. A feature wall also allows you to impose your individual tastes and personalize the room décor down to your deepest desires. However, feature walls are only as good as the ideas you are incorporating in the décor and the painter doing the paintwork.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Which wall should I paint as the feature wall? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>You use the feature walls to highlight the focal point in the room. It should be an existing focal point. The feature wall can be painted where your mantel or TV sits. In the bedroom, the wall that is behind the headboard can make for a great feature wall. There are some dos and don’ts when it comes to painting a feature wall. For instance, it should be noticeable. That is why it is a feature wall in the first place! Avoid painting feature walls in small and enclosed spaces as well as in rooms or walls with insufficient natural lighting.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should I paint a feature wall?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Surprise, surprise! Feature walls are still a thing in 2021. Feature walls are still a major part of interior decorating. They work perfectly for small spaces. By painting one wall in a striking colour and making it a focal point in the room, you can also bring out the illusion of depth in the room.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Should I make my feature walls lighter or darker? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Feature walls can have softer tones to soothe the eyes. Alternatively, you can use the darker tones to bring out the sense of space and depth, particularly in smaller rooms. Darker colour tones create a sharp contrast with the rest of the lighter-coloured walls and pull the eyes towards it. They make the feature wall the focal point in the room.</p>

<h4 class="h6">What is the trendiest colour for feature walls? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>There are lots of trendy colours that you can use for your feature walls. A common trend is to make it the same colour as the rest of the room but some shades lighter or darker. If you are looking for a more dramatic effect, you can go for colours such as Paris Grey, which was the most instagrammed colour in 2020.
