<p>We can also work on different types of floors ranging from commercial kitchens and high-traffic areas to the garage floors that typically require extensive prep work. An epoxy floor coating refers to a protective floor coating that is used to rejuvenate damaged or worn-out floors. Floors that are coated with epoxy are longer lasting and have better resistance to wear. The epoxy floor coating makes concrete floors less porous. You can, therefore, clean and maintain them with greater ease.</p>

<h3>House Painters Epoxy</h3>
<p></p><p>Epoxy coating involve the use of epoxy paint. It is an ideal floor coating solution for garage, patio or basement floors. Floors coated with epoxy have better resistance to scratching and grazing. They will fare much better when subjected to the rigors of daily use and the general wear-and-tear that emanates from this. Epoxy floor coating is a perfect solution for flooring in high traffic areas where the concrete floors will likely be subjected to considerable wear and tear.</p>
<p>This is why it is commonly used in commercial kitchens, showrooms, shopping centres, plant and equipment rooms, schools as well as in warehouses. The use of epoxy floor coating is also advantageous from a hygiene and aesthetic point. Epoxy coated floors are easier to clean and look nice in spite of the foot traffic.</p>

<div class="col-sm-6">
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">How Long Does Epoxy Coating Last?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Epoxy flooring will typically last you between 2 and 3 years in places with high foot traffic. This will be the case with commercial properties such as restaurants, garages, and factory spaces. However, if well maintained, epoxy flooring can last longer.</p>
<p>Epoxy or resin floor coating will last much longer in the low-traffic residential areas. You will get the most out of your epoxy flooring when you clean and maintain it well. We offer a warranty of up to 5 years for our professional residential epoxy floor coating in Melbourne.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Is an Epoxy Countertop Worth It? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>If epoxy coating is done well by a professional Melbourne painter, then it can result in a durable, long lasting finish. Epoxy coating is non-porous with excellent moisture resistance that should work well for countertops. Epoxy floor coating also has good heat resistance which lends itself easily to countertop uses. However, avoid placing heated pots on your epoxy countertops.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Does Epoxy Coating Scratch Easily? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Yes. Epoxy coating tends to scratch and stain easily. There are also epoxy products that are more susceptible to discoloration. Talk to our expert painters for professional advice on the best epoxy products to use on your disparate surfaces. The scratching and staining can leave ghastly marks on your surfaces, particularly as they age.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Will Epoxy Coating Get Slippery When Wet?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Although epoxy coating looks slippery, it might not actually be as slippery as we assume, particularly if it is well finished. Epoxy coating on your flooring can be augmented with skid-resistant additives that are added to the topcoat to make epoxy flooring less slippery and safer, even when the flooring is wet.&nbsp; If nonslip additives aren’t used, epoxy coated flooring can get dangerously slippery when wet, especially where there are oil spills.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Can Epoxy Coating Be Used Over Laminate Countertops? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Yes. Applying epoxy coating is a cost-effective way to refresh your laminate countertops and make them look new once more. With proper application by our professional epoxy coating experts, epoxy coatings will make your laminate countertops look more attractive, polished and they will also be more durable.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Can Epoxy Coating Be Used Outdoors?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Yes. Epoxy floor coating can be used outside. Due to the durability of epoxy floor coatings and their excellent resistance to the elements and wear, epoxy floor coatings can be reliably used for outdoor surfaces. However, it is important to keep in mind that epoxy products will discolour with time when exposed to UV rays.</p>
<p>Even UV stable epoxy products will deteriorate at a faster rate when exposed to sunshine. However, this deterioration is merely cosmetic. It ruins the aesthetics of the flooring without compromising its performance. If you don’t mind slight discolouration on your epoxy flooring, then you can comfortably use hard wearing epoxy floor products for your outdoor surfaces.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Is Epoxy Floor Coating Waterproof?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>While epoxy floor coating is not waterproof, it is reliably watertight. Whether planning to use epoxy floor coating on your countertops or in the outdoor spaces, we at Newline Painting have just the perfect solution for you.

<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Does Epoxy Floor Coating Crack? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>The various epoxy products have limits on how much stresses they can withstand. If this threshold is breached via excessive slab movement, impact or heat stress, then the epoxy floor coating can crack.</p>

<h4 class="h6">Can I Use Epoxy Floor Coating on My Bathroom? </h4>

<div class="accordion">
 <h4 class="h6">Where Can I Use Epoxy Floor Coating? </h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>Epoxy floor coating can be used in a wide array of floor applications including in supermarkets, commercial kitchens, car parks, bars, automotive industries, workshops, bakeries, schools and abattoirs among others.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">Can Epoxy Floor Coating Be Used Over Tiles?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>While epoxy floor coating can be applied over tiles, this application requires a more extensive preparation so as to fill up the drummy parts and grout lines before the new floor coating begins.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion">
<h4 class="h6">How Long Will the Epoxy Floor Smell Persists?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>After application, the epoxy floor coating smell can linger on for between 1 and 3 days. The strong odour emanating from the epoxy floor coating is from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in epoxy.</p>
<p>These compounds can cause irritation to the eyes, throat, nose and can even be a health hazard to other organs in the body. After the application of epoxy floor coating, it is strongly recommended that you leave the premises for a few days for the coating to dry off and the smell to subside.</p>

<h3>How Much Does Epoxy Floor Coating Cost?	</h3>
<p></p><p>Epoxy floor coatings generally cost between $30 and $35 per square metre. This is the quote for the application of two coats of epoxy over a concrete surface that is already well prepared. Depending on the condition of the concrete surface over which it is to be applied, the cost of epoxy coatings can be as high as $80 to $100 per square metre where there is preparation involving diamond grinding as well as decorative finishes.</p>
<p>The cost of epoxy floor coating will depend on a number of factors such as the state of the existing concrete, the size of the surfaces as well as the types of finishes that you want.</p>
<p>Naturally, you will pay a higher cost per square metre or per foot where the surface requires extensive prep work. Most of the expenses incurred in epoxy floor coatings cover the labour costs. Some professional epoxy floor coating experts generally consider the square footage and charge the cost based on that.</p>
<p>Finally, the type of epoxy used may also factor into the cost of epoxy floor coating in Melbourne. Solid epoxy is costlier than water-based epoxy. Solid epoxy gives a premium finish and lasts longer than water-based epoxy but if you are low on budget, you might consider using it in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>Overall, you get better rates when you have to apply epoxy floor coating over a larger surface area than over a small surface area. If you will be applying epoxy floor coating on garages, the prepping will involve some diamond grinding to make the concrete as smooth as possible. Garages also require two coats of epoxy. This is why epoxy garage floor coatings are typically costlier than that of other flooring with costs starting from $80 per square metre for a single car garage. For a double car garage, the cost of epoxy floor coating in Melbourne can start from $80 per square metre.</p>
<p>To get the most accurate cost estimates for epoxy floor coating on your premises, we recommend that you provide a detailed description on the condition of your floors as well as on the kinds of epoxy floor finishes that you want to achieve. When we have more information about your epoxy floor coating project, we are better placed to offer you very accurate epoxy floor coating quotes. Tell us whether the floor has some cracks that need repairs, if it is stained or whether you need to coat your garage floors. Garage floors, particularly, are usually in poor shape. When you give us accurate details on the condition of your floors, our epoxy floor specialists will prepare a comprehensive epoxy floor coating quote that factors in all the prep work and finishes that will have to be done on your flooring for flawless epoxy finishes.</p>
