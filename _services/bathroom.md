<p>We pay very close attention to all the aspects of professional bathroom painting. Our professional bathtub painters will be with you every step of the way right from choosing the right bathroom colours to performing the surface preparation, painting the bathroom and applying the finishing touches that will create that appealing space that you need to unwind in at the end of a hard day’s job.</p>

<h4 class="h6">What is the best paint for a bathroom?</h4>
<div class="accordion__hidden">
<p></p><p>The bathroom presents a different set of challenges from the rest of house interior. Due to the large wet and moist environment, a high-gloss paint must be used to combat the destructive effects of the wetness and moisture on the paintwork.</p>
<p>You also need to use a high-quality paint that will withstand the mould and mildew. High-gloss paints have higher levels of binders that create tight bonds capable of blocking the moisture.</p>
<p>An eggshell or satin finish is recommended for bathrooms. High-gloss finishing not only gives excellent water repelling capabilities but they are also easier to clean. They also give tougher finishes.</p>
